// Exercise 36: Returning a Value from a Function
// passing parameters into a method
// returning a value from a method

/*
Some functions have parameters and some do not. Parameters are the only way to send values into
a function. There is also only one way to get a value out of a function: the return value.
This exercise gives an example of a function that has three parameters (the side lengths of a triangle)
and one response: the area of that triangle using Heronâ€™s Formula.
