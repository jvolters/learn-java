public class TVActor{
	String name;
	String role;
	Integer salary; // added as study drill
}
/*
So the class TVActor contains two instance variables, and they are both Strings. 
The first variable is called name and the second is called role.
They are called 'instance' variables because each instance (copy) of the object 
gets its own copies of the variables.
